## Todos

- Should translate these into TDD unit tests
- Create button which fires up the launch page
- Write directives for common pieces of HTML that are gradually coming together
- Can I push this into a private repo?
- SASS best way of breaking this down??
- created main copy that includes the commented out toolbars and other things I will need to bring back in
- Reinstate the header directive, see if it were the missing DI declaration that was left out of the other file??

## Profile Page

- Separate the full name from login fields, that should only be shown during registration steps in some way
- Add avatar via drag and drop to a bordered box (see CSS tricks website)
  - Stores a medium size and a really small thumbnail of 100x100 on S3
  - Stored under nfolio/user1/avatar/medium|thumb
- What other fields should we have on this page?

## Image upload

- How about the possibilty of uploading a set of images per entry?

## Square cropping

- Wipe S3 files and data - try uploading a whole bunch of Malta photos and see how their crops look.
  - May need to make some big tweaks to the algorithm for this?
